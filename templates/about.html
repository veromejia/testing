        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Veronica's mother has diabetes and she continously asked Veronica to send a text as a reminder to take her
            medication
            daily, but Veronica can not keep track of that since she is occupied with her busy schedule as well. This is
            when
            the idea of MedReminder emerged. </p>
